A small clientside library for left hand animations, with slight support for legs animation as a bonus. For first person view only.
This only includes the base code and some models!
This only supports c_hand weapons!

Features:
Straightforward way to play left hand animations
Doesn't interfere/replace the gmod_hands entity
Camera calcview support (1st attachment of the model should be the camera bone)
Fully clientside
Runs only when it needs to (No FPS loss!)
Supports any c_ weapon that isn't a shoddy port 

If you're a developer, read this and dig into the lua files.

VManip stands for ViewModel Manipulation. There's a M missing but it looks cooler that way!
